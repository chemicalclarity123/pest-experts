### Service Areas (Local SEO)
We have implemented a dynamic, hyper-local SEO strategy for service areas (e.g., Pretoria, Sandton).

3. **FAQPage Schema** - Injected where applicable

## API & Data Fetching
- **GraphQL:** Legacy Apollo imports (https://vc8zkv1m.api.sanity.io/v1/graphql/production/default)
- **REST / GROQ:** Primary data fetching for new features (Service Areas, Knowledge Base, Global Settings) uses `@sanity/client` configured with `useCdn: true` for edge caching.
